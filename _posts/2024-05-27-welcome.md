Thank you for taking a look at my engineering portfolio! My name is Carlos Takeshita, and I am a senior mechanical engineering major at the University of California, San Diego. Although my background is diverse, I am particularly interested in automotive engineering, which has led me to opportunities such as leading the powertrain group of my FSAE team, Triton Racing, and interning at Tesla, Inc.

I take particular pride in my attention to detail when conceiving, designing and fabricating solutions to engineering problems, which I hope to demonstrate in my project posts, that can be seen on this site. I also enjoy expanding my skillset by taking on new opportunities that require me to learn new skills as I go.

Although I have done much work in the automotive field, I am a dedicated motorcyclist, with my only vehicle being a 2016 Suzuki GSX-S1000F, which I have had since 2019.
